So I have finally found the time and effort to recover and revive my blog.

<!-- more -->

And with that comes a change in hosting technology. As is pretty much custom at this stage.

One of the main differences is that this time I have used far more off the shelf components than any previous
incarnation of this blog. Another that it is all static this time. But, no I have not elected to write a whole
pile of HTML - or started using some kind of WYSIWYG site builder.

This time arround I have decided to go with a Static Site Generator - in partiuclar [Zola](https://getzola.org/).
This coupled with [nginx](https://nginx.org/) for actually doing the whole HTTP thing, [git](https://git-scm.org/)
for versioning, a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) as the host
system, and for good measure [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for... overkill?

Shortly I will write up a blog article on my adventures developing the [helm](https://helm.sh/) chart I developed
for this purpose, and the the fun unexpected side journeys that I ran into there thanks to the RasPi being arm64.

So yeah, for now - welcome back! I expect I shall shortly start ignoring this just as I have done every other
time in the past.
